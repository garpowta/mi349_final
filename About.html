        <p>When I have free time, I tend to spend most of it playing video games.  
        At the moment, the game I mainly play is SMITE, but throw in some other games
        like Rocket League, Valorant, and Call of Duty at times.  I have been a gamer
        my entire life, and started on the Nintendo 64 and Gameboy with Pokemon. </p>

            I am currently a member of the Michigan State Paintball Team.  I originally started playing paintball in 
            2016 for fun.  I generally would only play once or twice a year, but joined MSU's paintball team my sophmore 
            year (2018) and have been loving every second of it.  We hold practices every-other week, with conditioning 
            on the weeks we do not have practice.  We are a speedball team, meaning our games are extremely fast-paced, 
            and generally over within two minutes!  We play these speedball games in tournaments, and the teams are either 
            a five-verse-five, or three-verse-three.  Imagine ten people on a 40-50 yard field firing fully automatic paintball
            guns.  It gets very hectic right away, and that is why the rounds usually last less than two minutes.

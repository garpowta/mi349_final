        <p>When I have free time, I tend to spend most of it playing video games.  
        At the moment, the game I mainly play is SMITE, but throw in some other games
        like Rocket League, Valorant, and Call of Duty at times.  I have been a gamer
        my entire life, and started on the Nintendo 64 and Gameboy with Pokemon. </p>

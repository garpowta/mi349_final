        <p>When I have free time, I tend to spend most of it playing video games.  
        At the moment, the game I mainly play is SMITE, but throw in some other games
        like Rocket League, Valorant, and Call of Duty at times.  I have been a gamer
        my entire life, starting on the Nintendo 64 and Gameboy with Pokemon.</p> 
        <p>Once I got a PS3 I started to play Call of Duty.  My first Call of Duty game was, Call of Duty III.
            I only played the campaign for this game, and did not play any multiplayer for Call of Duty until 
            Modern Warfare 2 came out.  I did not play Modern Warfare 2 online very much, but the next Call of Duty to 
            be released was Call of Duty Black Ops, and I grinded the online part.  Every Call of Duty I would play through
            the campaign to start, and then play the multiplayer part.  Occassionally I would play zombies with my
            friends and try to complete easter eggs. 
        </p> 
        <p>Over the many years of playing Call of Duty, I began to sharpen my skills and be a top player.  Once Call of Duty
            Ghosts came out in 2013, I began to play competitively.  I found a group of guys that had a similar mind and skillset 
            as me to form a team.  We would practice just about everyday, and have a scrimmage against other teams three to four
            times a week.  On weekends we would play in tournaments that were mostly free to enter, but some required a fee to enter.
            We ended up being a decent team, but once Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare came out, we fell apart because the competitive 
            scene was mainly on Xbox, while we all played on PS3.  
        </p>
        <p>After another year, the competitive scene moved to Playstation, so I bought myself a PS4.  Being on many different teams
            for the different Call of Duty games, it really enhanced my teamwork and understanding for others because I played with 
            people of all different kind of personalities.  During Modern Warfare in 2019, I found a group of guys that were very 
            cool, calm, and collected.  We teamed up and ended up playing a tournament almost everyday.  Some of these tournaments 
            we played against the professional players that play on the big screen for millions of dollars.  One time we ended up 
            beating a team with three professional players in a wager match.

        <h2>Paintball</h2>

            I am currently a member of the Michigan State Paintball Team.  I originally started playing paintball in 
            2016 for fun.  I generally would only play once or twice a year, but joined MSU's paintball team my sophmore 
            year (2018) and have been loving every second of it.  We hold practices every-other week, with conditioning 
            on the weeks we do not have practice.  We are a speedball team, meaning our games are extremely fast-paced, 
            and generally over within two minutes!  We play these speedball games in tournaments, and the teams are either 
            a five-verse-five, or three-verse-three.  Imagine ten people on a 40-50 yard field firing fully automatic paintball
            guns.  It gets very hectic right away, and that is why the rounds usually last less than two minutes.

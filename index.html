    <h1 id="start" class="starting">Taylor Garpow</h1>
    <p>My name is Taylor Garpow and I am currently a senior at Michigan State University.
        When I first started at Michigan State my major was, Pre-Nursing, but I changed it 
        to Media and Information my sophmore year.  During my junior year MSU created a new 
        major, Games and Interactive Media, and I immediately changed my major to this.  With 
        most of my work being in Unity and C#, I decided to branch out and learn more coding languages
        like HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
    </p>
    <p>I just started an internship at DaySmart Software where I am in charge of their internal portal.
        Taking this class, Mi 349 Web Design and Development, gave me needed knowledge and skills to acquire 
    this internship and succeed.  Being they use HTML, CSS and Javascript, as well as Github, I was able to 
    be ahead of the competition because I had background knowledge.</p></section>
